# Implementation-of-Haffman-Coding

My Project of the Information Theory and Coding Course Offered in Fall 2022 @ Zewail City.

In this project, I implemented the Haffman Coding Algorithm.


## Implementation Steps:

            1) Designing a Huffman code for an English Language character set.
            2) Calculating the average length of the code and compare it to the entropy of the English Language.
            3) Encoding a text file that contains (Test1.txt) using the constructed codebook. 
            4) Designing a Huffman code depending on the frequency of occurrence of English letters in the text file.  
            5) Comparing the total length of the encoded bits in both cases. 

## The frequencies for English Language characters were obtained from:
